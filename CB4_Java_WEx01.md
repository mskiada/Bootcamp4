1.	Create a simple class that describes a Car. The class must have the following properties:
-	color (String)
-	numberOfDoors (int)
-	price (double)

The class must contain the following methods:
-	two constructors:
•	One without arguments that initializes color to white,  numberOfDoors to 5 and price to 5000
•	The second initializes the fields based on the given arguments
-	getters/setters
-	toString method

2.	In a separate class
-	Create two instances of the Car class car1 and car2 (using the different constructors)
-	Print them
-	Chance the price of car1 to 10.000 
-	Print car1 again
